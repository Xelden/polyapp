### Functional Requirements:
- Create a database with the most commonly used polymers (whether synthetic or biopolymers). In the database, each polymer will have an unique ID code and the specific characteristics of the polymer (e.g., elasticity, viscosity, etc.).
- Utilize web development technologies.
- Build a program that classifies similar polymeric materials (synthetic or biopolymers) and provides a possible response with suggestions based on polymer combinations (e.g., 20g of Polymer X + 30g of Polymer Y => output: name of the generated polymer + polymer characteristics).
- Implement a method in the system for the program to show the end user the necessary polymer mixture to generate the desired polymer they want to know about.
- Implement a method in the system that allows the user to select a polymer, and the application returns the measurements of the polymers to be mixed in order to achieve the initially chosen polymer.
- Design a cloud infrastructure architecture.
- Deploy the web application on a cloud service provider's server.
- Perform elasticity testing and real-time testing of the web application.

### System Requirements:
- Present to the end user the qualities or characteristics of the polymer resulting from the mixture of two or more polymers. The polymers to be mixed will be chosen by the end user.
- Suggest or provide general ideas about the product resulting from the mixture of the polymers chosen by the end user. In other words, the qualities and/or characteristics of the generated polymer.
- Display to the end user the necessary polymer mixture to generate the desired polymer they want to know about.
- Provide the end user with a specific set of properties that a polymer should have in order to perform the intended function the end user is seeking, and indicate whether it meets the criteria or not.
**Note:** The potential uses for the polymers will be previously provided by the client and will be presented based on the physical or chemical characteristics of the polymer. These uses will be recommended to the user after obtaining the product of the mixture of X polymers.
- Graphically notify the end user when a material cannot fulfill any of the intended industrial or common uses due to its qualities.
**Note:** The potential uses for the polymers will be previously provided by the client and will be presented based on the physical or chemical characteristics of the polymer. These uses will be recommended to the user after obtaining the product of the mixture of X polymers.
- Search for a polymer based on the fulfillment of its properties. In other words, the end user can use a search function within the application to find a polymer that satisfies property Z or properties N. The program should display all the polymers in the application's database that meet the properties entered by the user.
- Users authentication

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Design a wireframe.
- Design a mockup.
- Design a user interface that is visually appealing, minimalist, and conveys a professional tone.
- To be responsive-friendly.
- Implement security protocols and measures for the cloud server and the database.
